## 2. Market Opportunity

- **ABA therapy industry**: >$4B annually in the U.S.
- **Clinics face 4–6 week intake delays**; insurers face delayed claims data
- **Insurance denials** cost providers thousands annually per client and increase insurer/provider friction
- **Differentiator**: InTakeOff specializes in the first 30–60 days, ensuring clean data, accurate submissions, and better outcomes

## 3. Making It Valuable for Insurers

While fewer denials may seem unfavorable to insurers, InTakeOff creates win-win value:

### 3.1 Administrative Efficiency
- Cleaner claims submitted first time → lower payor admin costs from reprocessing
- Less time spent on phone calls, faxes, and appeals

### 3.2 Compliance & Risk Mitigation
- AI ensures claims meet documentation standards → reduces fraud/abuse risk
- Improves audit trails and provider accountability

### 3.3 Cost of Care Management
- Faster intake → earlier therapy start → fewer crises → reduced ER visits and higher long-term cost savings
- Provides payors with structured data (de-identified) for care management programs

### 3.4 Research & Network Adequacy
Aggregated analytics → insurers gain insight into:
- Wait times across providers
- Geographic network gaps
- Outcomes linked to earlier therapy start

### 3.5 Partnership Opportunities
- White-labeled intake portals co-branded with insurers
- Shared data dashboards to monitor provider efficiency
- Pilot programs tied to value-based reimbursement models

## 4. Expansion Potential

- **Beyond ABA**: Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy, Daycares/Schools
- **Payors benefit** from a unified intake standard across multiple pediatric disciplines
